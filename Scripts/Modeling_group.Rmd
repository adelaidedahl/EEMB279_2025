#FROM GUIDELINES:
At least one figure* presenting time-series simulations of the model. This figure should show how outcomes differ as a function of an interesting parameter(s). Make sure your figure includes a caption! (If you have many state variables, sometimes itâ€™s helpful for this to be split into two or more figures.)

At least one figure* presenting a bifurcation diagram with respect to an interesting parameter. Make sure your figure includes a descriptive caption!
